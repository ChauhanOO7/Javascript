1. What is Event Loop?

->  An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack(call stack) whenever
the function stack becomes empty.

->The event loop is the secret by which JavaScript gives us an illusion of being multithreaded even though it is single-threaded.

2. Why do we need event loop?

-> To handle the events efficiently.

3. How it works?
